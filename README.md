## Requirements

* macOS (developed under High Sierra, but should work with 10.8 and later)
* A working Nightscout setup ([cgm-remote-monitor])

## Installation

1. Download [this zip file containing the app][release-zip] and unzip it.
1. Drag "Nightscout Menubar" into your "Applications" folder.
1. Run it.
1. (Optional) To run automatically on startup, go to System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items, and add Nightscout Menubar to the list.

## Customization

For now, if you want to customize the display and are comfortable making small edits to a Python file, you can edit [nightscout_osx_menubar.py] within the app package.

In Finder, right-click on the app and click "Show Package Contents". Open `Contents/Resources/nightscout_osx_menubar.py` in a text editor. All the available configuration is at the top of the file.

For example:

* Change `HISTORY_LENGTH` to control the number of history menu items
* Change `MENUBAR_TEXT` to `u"{sgv} {direction}"` to shorten the menu bar text to only BG and a trend arrow
* Change `MENU_ITEM_TEXT` to likewise change how the history items are formatted
* Modify `time_ago` to return strings like "5m" instead of "5 min"
* etc.

This is not a long-term solution since your modifications won't survive a reinstall of the app. A better configuration system is in the works.

## Development

This uses [rumps], which provides a nice interface to PyObjC to create simple menu bar apps, and [py2app], a Python setuptools command which allows you to package Python scripts as standalone OS X applications.

**To run the app in development:**

```
git clone https://github.com/mddub/nightscout-osx-menubar
cd nightscout-osx-menubar
pip install -r requirements.txt --user  # This may take a while
python nightscout_osx_menubar.py
```

* Install requirements with `--user` because [rumps is not compatible with virtualenv][rumps-virtualenv]. You could alternatively `sudo pip install`.
* If this fails, try [installing Xcode Command Line Tools][xcode-cli].

**To build a standalone app in `dist/`:**

```
python setup.py py2app
```

## Troubleshooting

* If an error occurs while running the standalone app, some additional information was probably logged to the Console app (in Applications > Utilities).

* To view the app's output in the terminal and get extra debug information, start the app from the command line with the `--debug` flag:
  ```
  cd /Applications
  ./Nightscout\ Menubar.app/Contents/MacOS/Nightscout\ Menubar --debug
  ```
